       <p>
    My name is José Miguel Panadero Pérez, and I specialize in Information Technology, currently based in the vibrant city of Málaga. Passionate about emerging technologies, I thrive on exploring and experimenting with cutting-edge tools and frameworks that inspire innovation within the IT community.
    <br><br>
    I excel in coding and software engineering, leveraging a strong aptitude for learning and critical self-evaluation. While technical expertise is essential, I also dedicate time to honing my communication and leadership skills through continuous research and reading. I pride myself on a methodical approach and an unwavering commitment to understanding the core of complex problems, fueling my passion for lifelong learning and growth.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in DevOps and Cloud Aquitectures, deepening my expertise in scalable infrastructures, CI/CD pipelines, and modern cloud computing practices. This academic journey complements my hands-on experience and reinforces my dedication to staying at the forefront of the IT industry.
    <br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies that can enhance my skills as an engineer. I'm also passionate about staying active, practicing martial arts, going to the gym, and immersing myself in reading. I frequently participate in IT challenges such as hackathons, where I enjoy pushing my creative and technical boundaries. Additionally, I love designing and playing video games with friends, blending innovation, teamwork, and fun.
